Created event Scheduler

# Features
1. Event Creation:
•	A form to schedule a new event with fields: Event Name, Description, Start Time, Start Date, End Time, and End Date.
•	Upon submission, events should appear in both a list and a calendar view.

2. Event Views:
•	List View: Display events in chronological order with options to edit or delete them.
•	Calendar View: Display events in a monthly calendar format. Clicking on a day should list the events for that particular day below the calendar.

3. Event Editing and Deletion:
•	An "Edit" button next to each event to modify its details.
•	A "Delete" button to remove an event.

4. Responsive Design:
The application should adapt gracefully across devices – desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

5. Integrations:
•	Integrate MirageJS to simulate real-world CRUD operations.
•	Add filtering options in the List View based on event name or date.
•	Use a state management tool Context API to manage the application's state, especially for the time-based notifications and event lists.
